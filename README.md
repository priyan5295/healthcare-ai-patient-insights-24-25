## 🔎 Key Visual Insights

### 🚬 Cancer Status (Smoker vs Non-Smoker)
- **Smokers:** 405
- **Non-Smokers:** 1922  
📌 Observation: Smoking strongly correlates with higher long-term health expenditure.

### ⚖ Charges by Weight Status
- 🟥 Obese — **Highest**
- 🟧 Overweight — **Moderate**
- 🟦 Normal — **Lower**
- 🟩 Underweight — **Lowest**  
📌 Obesity is the strongest cost-driver.

### 🩸 Diabetes & HBA1C Cost Analysis
- **Diabetic → Highest**
- **Prediabetic → Moderate**
- **Normal → Lowest**  
📌 Clear relationship between severity & financial impact.

### 🏥 Hospital Tier-wise Cost Insights
- 🟦 Tier-2 — **Highest charges & complexity**
- 🟨 Tier-1 — **Moderate**
- 🟩 Tier-3 — **Lowest**  
📌 Tier-2 hospitals handle complex, high-cost cases.

## 💡 Strategic Insight Summary
### 📊 Descriptive
- Majority are non-smokers
- Obesity significantly increases healthcare cost
